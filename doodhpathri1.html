            <p>
              Saral Lake is located on border of Neelam and Kaghan Valley in
              Pakistan at an altitude of 13,600 feet (4,100 m). <br />
              The lake is accessible from Sharda by a jeepable track which leads
              to Gumot National Park and then through hiking trek can be reached
              to the lake
              <br /><br />
              Nestled in the serene landscape of Kashmir, Sarbal Lake is a
              pristine, lesser-known destination that captivates with its
              untouched beauty. Located near the base of the majestic Amarnath
              peak, this glacial lake remains a hidden gem, away from the
              throngs of tourists that usually flock to more popular spots.
              <br /><br />

              The journey to Sarbal Lake is an adventure in itself, involving a
              trek through lush meadows, dense forests, and rocky terrains. The
              trail offers breathtaking views of snow-capped mountains, making
              it a paradise for nature lovers and trekking enthusiasts. As you
              approach the lake, the landscape transforms into a tranquil
              setting, with the crystal-clear waters reflecting the surrounding
              peaks like a mirror. <br /><br />

              Sarbal Lake is not just a feast for the eyes but also holds
              spiritual significance for locals. It is considered sacred, and
              its serene environment adds to the sense of peace and reflection
              that many visitors experience here. <br /><br />

              Whether you're seeking adventure, tranquility, or simply a place
              to connect with nature, Sarbal Lake offers an unforgettable
              experience in the heart of Kashmir's unspoiled wilderness..

              Tosa Maidan: The Unexplored Meadow of Kashmir
            </h4>
            <p>
              Tosa Maidan, also known as Toshamaidan, is a 65 sq km meadow and
              hill station in the Khag area of the Budgam district in Jammu and
              Kashmir, India. It's located in the Pirpanjal range, about 45 km
              from Srinagar and 10 km from Khag, at an altitude of 10,395 ft.
              Tosa Maidan is known as the "King of Meadows" and is a popular
              tourist destination <br /><br />
              Tosa Maidan is famous for its historical background and as a
              pasture. The name also refers to the historic route into the
              Kashmir Valley from the Poonch Valley. The area is surrounded by
              dense forests and is a starting point for many trekking trails.
              Some say it's an ideal place for less crowded treks. One trek, the
              Tosamaidan and Greater Lakes Trek, takes hikers through
              picturesque trails to high-altitude lakes like Damam sar,
              Gadtar-sar, Bodh Gadtasar, Sandooq Sar, and Bante sar.
              <br /><br />
              To get to Tosa Maidan, you can fly into Srinagar airport and then
              drive 70 km to the base camp. The drive includes a rough, 7 km
              off-road section from Sithaharan to Tosa Maidan. Some recommend
              bringing a 4x4 vehicle because the weather can be unpredictable.
              <br /><br />
              Tosa Maidan, a vast meadow nestled in the Budgam district of
              Kashmir, is a stunning example of the region's untouched natural
              beauty. Once a restricted area due to its use as an artillery
              range by the Indian Army, Tosa Maidan has since been opened to the
              public, revealing its lush green pastures, vibrant wildflowers,
              and panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. The meadow,
              often referred to as the "Hidden Jewel of Kashmir," is ideal for
              trekking, camping, and nature walks. The expansive landscape,
              dotted with dense forests and crossed by sparkling streams, offers
              a sense of peace and seclusion rarely found in more crowded
              tourist spots. The area's rich biodiversity is another attraction,
              with various bird species and wildlife making it a paradise for
              nature enthusiasts. <br /><br />

              Tosa Maidan is also steeped in local culture and history. The
              meadow has been a traditional grazing ground for shepherds and is
              surrounded by villages that offer a glimpse into the simple,
              pastoral life of Kashmir. For those seeking an off-the-beaten-path
              adventure, Tosa Maidan provides an unforgettable experience,
              combining breathtaking natural beauty with a deep connection to
              the region's cultural heritage.

            <h4 class="text-success">Yus Marg: The Meadow of Jesus</h4>
            <p>
              Yusmarg is known for its grassy pastures and deep forests, with
              the snow-covered mountains forming a stunning backdrop. Around 2
              hours (90 km) away from Gulmarg, pristine Yusmarg is one of the
              less-frequented tourist spots in the Kashmir Valley. <br /><br />
              Doodh Ganga, translating to “River of Milk,” is a serene
              watercourse that meanders through the heart of Yusmarg, adding to
              the tranquility of the surroundings. The river is fed by melting
              snow from the surrounding mountains, contributing to its
              crystal-clear and refreshing waters.
              <br /><br />
              The potent River Doodh Ganga rises from several high-altitude
              peaks and a distributory of the same flows into the reservoir.
              Tord 'Yus' is said to be a short form of Youza or Jesus and a marg
              means a meadow, it is believed that Jesus passed through this
              valley while travelling into Kashmir. <br />
              Yusmarg, often referred to as the "Meadow of Jesus," is a
              breathtakingly beautiful hill station located in the heart of
              Kashmir. Situated about 47 kilometers from Srinagar, Yusmarg is a
              serene escape into nature, far removed from the hustle and bustle
              of city life. This pristine destination is known for its rolling
              meadows, dense pine forests, and stunning views of snow-capped
              mountains. The name Yusmarg is believed to be derived from the
              legend that Jesus Christ once visited this area, adding a layer of
              mystique to its already enchanting landscape. The lush meadows
              stretch out as far as the eye can see, dotted with wildflowers in
              the spring and blanketed in snow during winter. The Doodh Ganga
              River flows nearby, adding to the tranquil atmosphere with its
              gentle, soothing sound. <br /><br />

              Yusmarg is a haven for nature lovers, trekkers, and those seeking
              solitude. Popular activities include trekking to nearby sites like
              Nilnag Lake, horse riding through the picturesque meadows, and
              simply soaking in the natural beauty that surrounds you. With its
              unspoiled charm and serene ambiance, Yusmarg offers a perfect
              retreat for anyone looking to experience the untouched splendor of
              Kashmir.
